## Pipelines

Dracon utilises [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/) to execute a given Dracon Pipeline.

There are example pipelines in the `./examples/pipelines` directory which are advised to be used as a base for your own Pipelines.

A Pipeline directory consists of all resources required to run a Pipeline which includes:
 - Tekton Tasks
   - Dracon Producers
   - Dracon Consumers
   - Dracon Enrichers
   - Dracon Sources
 - A Tekton Pipeline
 - A Tekton PipelineRun
 - Any further Tekton PipelineResources external to Dracon resources e.g. Git Source


### Using Secrets
Some tools, or even cloning your repository may require secrets. The following sections describe how to do this.

#### Git+SSH Cloning

An example `pipeline-run.yaml` for cloning via Git+SSH using Kubernetes Secrets is available at `./examples/git-ssh.pipeline-run.yaml` which provides the following resources:
 - `Secret`: To store the "secret" data such as SSH private key and trusted host public key
 - `ServiceAccount`: For Tasks within the Pipeline to assume this account and gain access to the secret
 - `PipelineResource`: Utilise Tekton's built in git resource kind to fetch git source code
 - `PipelineRun`: that uses the service account and git resource.


#### Using Secrets in Tasks

An example of changed resources to support using secrets in Tasks is available in `./examples/use-secrets.task.yaml` which provides the following resources:
 - `Secret`: To store the "secret" data such as SSH private key and trusted host public key
 - `ServiceAccount`: For Tasks within the Pipeline to assume this account and gain access to the secret
 - `PipelineResource`: Utilise Tekton's built in git resource kind to fetch git source code
 - `PipelineRun`: that uses the service account and git resource.
 - `Task`: to use the secret in an environment variable.
